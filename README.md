# FMGen

### Generate, audition, and save FM SynthDefs using random procedures.

FMGen is a class to generate n number of FM SynthDefs stored in SuperCollider code (rather than def file format.) FM configurations include multimodulator, multicarrier, and parallel. The SynthDefs are generated pseudorandomly with class arguments for specifying number, type, etc. The original code inspiration for this Quark is the James McCartney example file '100 FM Synths.scd' included in the SuperCollider distribution examples. 

### Installation

Open up SuperCollider and evaluate the following line of code:
`Quarks.install("https://github.com/scottericpetersen/FMGen-Quark")`
